# Homework Week 5
For this week, we learned about batch processing using PySpark and Spark SQL and did the homework using data about NYC taxi trips (fhv trips in October 2019) provided [here.](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhv/fhv_tripdata_2019-10.csv.gz)

# File Description
In this homework, I had run a spark cluster on local machine and processed data using a jupyter notebook as shown in `Homework Week 05.ipynb`.
- `fhv/2019/10/*` - result files after repartitioning
- `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` - taxi zone data
